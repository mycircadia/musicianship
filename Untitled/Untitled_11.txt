Take it for what it is
Is what they said
But this was written in vain
And the knife is poised above the vein
All the red rushed through with life
So you vault the final fence
Your heart left with no defense
You were keen on her
The one you thought would make you sure
And finally take the open hand
But I wont see them free
They’ll just try to joke
But the fires never tire
We stoke the heart of hearths
And the flames burn higher

--c--
When you look into his eyes
It moves you near to why
My heart beats still
Far and away from will
Now I see it in the pale gray covered skies
That were meant to meet with you
Yes now I see it in the pale gray covered skies
And they are headed towards you
--c--

Far beyond the last fence
You passed your lone estate
The solid beams now turned to dust 
The nails now let to rust
You had known the walls to make
And what you’d forsake
But on nights you lay awake
Silence the throbbing ache
No chest that rose and fell
Let free then grown with a swell
So the flicker of your soul
A spark in your eyes
The fuel from your heart
Lit the match that marked the start
The pain now a flame again
But always a bright scar
And in the night a guiding star


How good, how simple
To loose this pistol heart,
To Shingle the walls,
And Shelter these halls
From the holes
You throw through me.
This is why
There’s still a sigh
Traveling near and high
That will lead you now
Till you finally find
That in your mind
There’s nothing
For you to see but me

--b--
But we are young when we learn
That grandfather’s clock turns to a tick
That this steal is never bent
And that as it was meant
Lower burns the wick

And the ash will line your lungs
Scald and scar your own tongue
And parch the verse
That’s been strung
Forever whole
And coiled in your soul
--b--

--c--
When you look into his eyes
It moves you near to why
My heart beats still
Far and away from will
Now I see it in the pale gray covered skies
That were meant to meet with you
Yes now I see it in the pale gray covered skies
And they are headed towards you
--c--
