Mother listen to my heart
The first beat marks the start
But each one’s closer to when we’ll part

Father show me who to be 
I wish to see what you see
For it’s more than what I’ve seen in me

You told me once it’ll be just what it’s been
And to live for what there is between
Not for the things you’ve yet to see
It’ll all come round it’s a matter of when

Brother tell me where to go
Times the only thing I know
With so little its hard to take things slow

Sister am I all alone
Have I run too far from home
Don’t let me tear the love that’s sewn

You told me once it’ll be just what it’s been
And to live for what there is between
Not for the things you’ve yet to see
It’ll all come round it’s a matter of when
