I’ve been at the end
Stole a look beyond the bend
But for me nothing did descend
As no faith has been my friend

It’s long been said
That men like me are dead
A soul that’s been mislead
And believes not what he’s read

Hold me now
And take me now
So I might bow before your crown

Tell me how
And show m how
So guilt will never line my brow

I’d never been a giver
But I took a ride downriver
Though at first I did shiver
I felt the love that it delivered

I’d been the worried kind
Always a question on my mind
For my time till now I’d been blind
To the one that I must find

Hold me now
And take me now
So I might bow before your crown

Tell me how
And show me how
So guilt will never line my brow

To the life I now see
Hold my hand and make it real
And my skin soft so I can feel
Cause I’ve never been true to me
