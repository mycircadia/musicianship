In movements of dreams it was not what it seemed
When what I had seen was the way that it could’ve been
So I throw back the drinks and chase them with pride
As if it could take me back

But nothing I have tried will bring me to my peace
Or pull back the fog on the things that I see
Every step that I take is just one less I’ll make
To find my way back to you 

The way that I see no path parts its ways
No trail weaved through the woods for me to take
This life’s been made to walk without aim
To move and make my own

So I’ve dressed with care and done it all with the rest
But there’s no place that’s been more of a mess
Than that place I keep down deep in my chest
Or my life as its been so far

When I sleep
When you speak

It’s my soul
That you keep
