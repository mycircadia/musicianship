The fear is me
That what you’ll see’s
Not what I’ve come to be

For now I hang truth
With fears you’ve yet to soothe
For now hope’s no light
In my dark rooms tonight

Faith and promise
Hold my conscience
And turn me cautious
But you’ll make me honest

All the things I knew
Will leave me with you
All the faith I keep
I’ll leave with you to seek

I’m halfway gone
Never held on
Or felt my own dawn
Still playin a players pawn

I am no one’s son
Least not the kind I’ve heard of
I am far from home
But it’s never where I’m from 

My soul’s been bound and intertwined
All twisted up in something I cant leave behind
But tell me and ease my mind
Whether yours is bound in kind.
