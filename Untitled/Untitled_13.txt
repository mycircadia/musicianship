There’s a day and a dream
And they ain’t too far between
But the truth ain’t what it seems
For stumbling against the wind
Nameless faces seem far from kin
But separation’s never been more than the place we’re in

When you take it all at once
It get’s hard to know you’re still awake
So if and when
Or if it’s then
That I make it my place
To run and chase you down
And make you my own
To save me from being alone

Just know it’s getting harder and harder
To fight the burning turning feeling
That if I were wise id known the wrong in time
But I guess that in and for the while it’ll be mine
In those walks I was taken by your eyes
And the shy silent hand set on mine
But the fool for two who was lost in you
Oh through and through he never knew

There isn’t much to say it’ll change
Or that this is what’s been prearranged
But i can’t wait for winter to grow old
And season aren’t a thing we can turn
Yet hope in fate’s of my least concern, as it’s shown none in return

Just know there’s a day and a dream
And Though I still live in reveries
It’s always been
So take it then
I’ll be making it my place
To run and chase it down
And make it my own
To save me from being alone

Now it’s getting harder and harder
To fight the burning turning feeling
That this ain’t the place to be
