We all move on slow
Getting to where we’ll go
And in my mind
All things will grow
All things will grow

This is what we crave
To know that we’ve been brave
And in my mind
I’m in my grave
I’m in my grave

I was once in love
And I’m made of what it was
Now in my mind
I hold that love
I hold that love

Will we be so just?
When you’ve lost all our trust
And in my mind
All is to dust
All is to dust

The world you found
Now one rushing sound
Drums at the boards
And pounds one last chord
The final Breath of an unsung score
