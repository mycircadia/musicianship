The suns got more life than me today
Though it’d be cause I cant see that way
So please be kind and change my mind
Make me see more or what’s in store 
Tell me just what to find

It’d be fun to roam but take me home
It’s what I’ll miss but I guess there’s just more to this 
I never remember feeling the way I do 
Though I might say its cause I knew
That they were never you

We all worry worry and hurry hurry
Just livin on lovin somethin we can’t ever have
We don’t have the time to read the signs
So we Run along and forget those songs 
They say that’s way to be?

That’s the life I knew till I met you
Walking ropes and running on hopes
Don’t you agree or can’t you see
I know that it’s been a bit too slow
But isn’t this the way to be?
