As I turn my back
The long streak of sky burns to black
This face by my side
Never seemed so far behind

This road takes me home
But it’s far from where I’ve roamed
The faces look the same
But I’ve forgotten all their names

Hope to breathe back life
In sparks that will again burn bright
Has held me in chains
Though a knife’s above the vein

Taken by the bends
There is only an end
But no voice or siren’s song
Can break how I hold on

Gone from that old place
Once it all seemed seamless and shielded
But home left with us
What was trust has turned to dust 

Hope’s a funny thing
The timeworn friend has taken wing
But it doesn’t matter
For I can't let this ash scatter

Sick and six feet deep
Neither knows the feeling that we keep
Grace is in the name
The same that we refuse to claim

Taken by the bends
There is only an end
But no voice or siren’s song
Can break how I hold on
