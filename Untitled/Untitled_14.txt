kidsI’ve been headed down a road I’ve known before
The place is rearranged
And the faces they may have changed
But I haven’t been this sure since I left so many years ago

I may have climbed to where the sun breaks through
But I’ve spread myself thin and far apart
Cause when I get too close
I start to feel the weather round here

--c--
But I set aside the fear long enough to see
That the weight I hold has got its way once more
Just like it did before
--c--

When the harp strings finally tore
And they tore down the rough and scored line of my heart
And they sang with the dissonance that I knew from the start
So now I do nothing but run it into the rear view
And I’ve been trying to keep it there


So when she calls don’t tell her where I’ve gone
She can go on thinkin’ that the pain holds on
But to me it’s hope that’s died and been foregone
Now’s the time to raise those walls

So now she’s in the rear view
Fading like the wind or a setting sun
If leavin’s ever to be an easy thing
It’s to be done like you were shot from a gun
But when’s that a thing I’ve ever done?

--c--
I just can’t set aside the fear long enough to see
That the weight I hold has got its way once more
Just like it did before
--c--

When the harp strings finally tore
And they tore down the rough and scored line of my heart
And they sang with the dissonance that I knew from the start
I could do nothing but run it into the rear view
So now I try to keep it there




So I could ask why she never left me
And lingered high in my mind like a ghost
But I know and it’s something I always see
Perhaps there was a reason why

--c--
When the harp strings finally tore
And they tore down the rough and scored line of my heart
And they sang with the dissonance that I knew from the start
I could do nothing but run it into the rear view
So now I try to keep it there
