Come with the memory
Come with your sided story
Come with the salt from you seamless kitchen table
Come pour it in my wounds where I’d stood like babel
And once again I’ll see the stain
The plain undying wrench of a dull pain

The shivering question on quivering lips
Still alive but dying drowning
Dying down in worry

So my suits of restrain are pressed till petrified
But on the day we find the time
And try to find the long long ago

We’ll see that reminiscence once disavowed 
Will not bow to your now great throne
For time will not change what has aged to stone
