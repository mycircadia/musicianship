I remember
Buried in the dirt
Was my own love
Far below the hurt 

But there was a day
When he did say
To me and my heart
That this was not the way

But here for me
Lost in the rain
There’s nothing that’s free
But here for me
To put aside the pain
Meant I couldn’t see

So as a man
And the way I am
Without this old cane
I knew not how to stand

But don’t worry
I’ll find a way for me
That I will see
To bring me peace at last

But by no will
No will but mine
I must look
To see his kind hand
Stretched out to me
