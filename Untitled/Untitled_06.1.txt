Whatever place you were living then
Wasn’t close enough for me back then
The dollars and the drinks filled in
For a space that you should’ve been

I was thinking about it for days
Was thinking ‘bout what I’d cast away
Though there wasn’t much to reassess
Hope’s got more on less than I had guessed

Fate’s a face I never knew
That is till I met you
I would come to know
That Hope’s the last of love
And if it’s all I have left
I should see that I’ve been blessed

Whatever sea I’d set sail to cross
The wind saw it best that I be lost
That I would lie down upon the frost
There before the station of the cross

I sat dreaming bout the days to come
Marching on to the beating of a drum
Sung to the anthem of a man undone
A man shot down by a poet’s gun

Strung up to the ties of my own strings
I played along found joy in little things
But love doesn’t need stories of kings
Only the voices from which to sing

When our eyes finally aligned
You voice grew in mine
And my world slowly turned in time

Till then I was a fool It’s true
But now I’m one for you
So now I see
That Hope’s the last of love
And if it’s all I have left
I’ll know that I’ve been blessed
