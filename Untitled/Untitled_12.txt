--v1--
Almost nothing, seems for sure
But in my dreams I fall for her
I’ve been made to hold out, on the line
Here brave and bold and fear align

Things so seldom, stay the same
Yet there was a way, and they came
So I had to take what, they had torn
And move me to make, it more

But I’m right here in the simple seconds,
That burden, 
my beckoned mind
And there’s a time
I will find
I’ve lingered in the sea
The hidden fantasy
And I’ll drift down
Till the voices rouse
And I will wake just to drown

--c--
Teach me to know a lighter gentler way 
Teach me to go, with,out the, num,bered, days (go on)
--c--

--v2--
Teach me the gentler way
To leave the numbered days
Show me the gentler way
Ignore our numbered days
Until my hear is carried away
