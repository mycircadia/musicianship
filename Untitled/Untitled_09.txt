I know what I’ve been before
But not what I was for
So I took what they had torn
And made it so much more

There’s a legion from the divide
Yet faith’s no cure for what’s outside
And discipline’s a storm in the mind
No matter the words you’ve underlined

But it’s fine not to really know
Just to see that it’s just so
And it’s not made to say in speech
So far and lost to us who reach

We’re aware of black and white
But the greys never see the light
For shadows come alive with it
There’s nothing that will be lit

Cover your eyes
Cover your soul
And don’t let lies take their toll
Or fulfill some role-ruined time

We’ve lingered in the sea’s
Cryptic fantasy
And we drift on down
Till the human voices rouse
And we awake just to drown

Within a heart that always fails
Within our cities raised
You saw what you saw
So wont you sway
To put down your scales
And lay down your law
But fuck what they taught ya
And let them
Let them
Let them
Lead you back to me
So you finally
Run till you find
That in your mind
There’s nothing
For you to see but me
