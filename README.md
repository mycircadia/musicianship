###Musical Endeavours

> I have been playing music, in one form or another, for more
> than ten years now. At the moment I'm pretty bogged down in
> my studies as a physics undergrad and sadly I haven't had much
> time to myself. So if it appears that I haven't been very
> active musically that wouldn't be too far from the truth.
> Hopefully in my time off I'll be able to focus on music a bit
> more. So Thats a bit a about me at the moment and my music,
> hope you enjoy what I've got to offer.
