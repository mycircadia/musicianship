Amaj7  *Amaj7 *F             C7         F
adrift on the wind makin its way like before
Amaj7     *Amaj7  *F         C7	  		     F
the light-ness of white was asway back and forth

and he, did the same without a need to explain
why red, lit roads knew the delay he became

It, was all his own though but he'd always think,
with his, arms at a bar on just one more drink

So rom-ance was heavy and hard just like him
and, yet remberance was enough to begin

Amaj7         C/F           Amja7              C/F
he's kissin a cigarrette 'neathe the downtown gloom
Am/C                         C/F    Amaj7    C/F    Amaj7
wearing the smoke like its perfume
Amaj7                  C/F            Amja7        C/F
but the glare from the neon signs shines right on through
Am/C                    C/F    Amaj7    C/F    Amaj7
onto what no one really knew

timmid beats their heart of hopes
dimmed by his hollow home of smoke
timmid beats his heart of hopes
dimmed by his hollow home of smoke

Amaj7         C/F           Amja7              C/F
he's kissin a cigarrette beneathe the downtown gloom
Amaj7                    C/F            Amja7        C/F
while the glare from the neon signs shines right on through
?
onto just them two
