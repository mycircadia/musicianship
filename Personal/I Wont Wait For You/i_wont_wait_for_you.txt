i_wont_wait_for_you
-------------------

Held a heart to fill
In dark and hidden hills
As if it was a way to will
But I’m here still

If I could say this
It’d be that it’s you I missed
Though the fear and tears persist
Know it’s you I kissed

My love had grown
Not on thrones of solid stone
But on hope that this was home
And home alone

--c--
Please, there is no need to stay
We’ll drink to all this someday
And say that way leads on to way
By a will we cannot sway

So leave me by the cold stone
And let free the swirling snow
This old heart is mine alone
This much you must come to know
--c--

Its come to this
Hope that hangs on one last kiss
On lips that in this remiss
This I can fix

But you wear away
Tear and fray on words I say
They say that there was a way
But not today

We’re six feet deep
In promises we wont keep
It’s time to wake from this sleep
And set this free

We’ve had our time
And you took enough of mine
These lines no longer intertwine
This you can’t deny

--b--
I would stay for you
I would pray for you
But that didn’t mean much to you
So I won’t wait for you

I was free for you
I would plea for you
But that didn’t mean much to you
So I won’t wait for you
--b--

--c--
Please, there is no need to stay
We’ll drink to all this someday
And say that way leads on to way
By a will we cannot sway

So leave me by the cold stone
And let free the swirling snow
This old heart is mine alone
This much you must come to know
--c
