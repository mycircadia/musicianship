Listen for the comedy
And the jest he’s never seen
Listen to the words of the man
That we won’t soon see again

Did he find a piece last night?
The piece he knew he couldn’t fight?
So soft is the travesty
When all that he hoped to be

Was nothing more
Than a face a stone
In a soft lamp’s light
With silent lips
Never wrong
Never right

With smile in bed you awoke
Yet for him you could have spoke
To a passing of the longer miles
But you never did all the while

There’s a place for us for him
That’s made with our love on a whim
There’s a quiet comedy 
In the words our days never see

A quiet comedy when
We’ve worked till we’re sore
And we finally find
That what we’ve been

Is nothing more
Than a face a stone
In a soft lamp’s light
With silent lips
Never wrong
Never right
