You look into his eyes
With a sigh traveling near to why
My heart beats still
Far and away from will

In those gray lined skies
All I’ve hoped for lives
But never is

When I see those faded photos
I douse the flame your name
Sets in my mind
 
And the ash will line your lungs
Scald and scar your own tongue
And parch the verse
That’s been strung
Forever whole
And coiled in your soul

How good, how simple
To loose this pistol heart,
To Shingle the walls,
And Shelter these halls
From the holes
You throw through me.
This is why
There’s still a sigh
Traveling near and high
That will lead you now
To you finally find
That in your mind
There’s nothing
For you to see but me
