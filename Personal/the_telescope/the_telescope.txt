-------------

The night folds on and on in limitless supply
There you hold your gaze upon the sky
And the stars flicker on and on a tinted, twisted, telescope
Its mirrors prisms of your prison cell

There lies the crooked image in your eye
It’s a shattered surface and hazy purpose
When you find all that you believe is interweaved
Tightly tied in the subtlety of gravity

Yet there’s no relief when you know
The movements of the stars are just so…
…Far beyond your heart and your control
All the light that you posses now is broken in the darkest holes
All is Lost to care and past repair

So I will fashion by profession a lens a key
It’s mirror so pristine and so serine
It will flash against the sky and sparkle in your eye
It’s then that you will see beauty in the first degree

In and for the while you’d be mine
I’d hold you in my arms and gone with tired eyes
If I was wise id have known the wrong in time
But In and for the while it was mine
