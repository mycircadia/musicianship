a_tangled_vine
--------------

Words hold little more than lies
My voice the hand that sows the seeds
But silence cannot hide my guise
Or my mind’s matted field of weeds

I am joining all my thoughts
Preparing every part of me
For the thing that I once sought
To be part of the world you see

So that you might take of me
All that I can give up to you 
I hold still this silent plea
That now you will see me anew

--c--
The wind is mine
If I see it so
This life is mine
If I see it so
But you a tangled vine
In my mind
It’s you I must redefine
You I must find
Life was as good this far
But I am lost in what you are
--c--

I head from the trees in stride
In search of something to confess
Just to wade in rivers wide
Black seeped from places I repress

I come with names from the hills
Wound in a whisper on the wind 
Though quiet the voices build
And the crooked lips turn a grin

I see the words willed in stone
By the name that is always here
I stand with the hope alone
That faith will one bright day be clear

--b--
When I see your eyes
Draw from mine my lies

Take from me this night
The hurt I hold in spite

From all the times before
That love must answer for 

Hold me tight this night
Hold me till the morning light
--b--

--c--
The wind is mine
If I see it so
This life is mine
If I see it so
But there’s a tangled vine
In my mind
It’s you I must redefine
You I must find
Life was as good this far
But I am lost in what you are
--c--

If life were the dew of love
Have I lived or put hope in fate
If life were drawn in ink above
Have I lived or let this go too late

Do we make a sound out there?
Or dare we disturb the sacred place
Slowly can we breathe that air?
Or do we choke on fear’s embrace

Are we part of greater space?
Or do we fall in and out of time
And tumble from hands of grace
Striding lightly beside the line
