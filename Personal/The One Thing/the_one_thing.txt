When I think of all the things, you won't remember
that keep this ember burn bright, through this long december

And I can drink through the night, so I can forget
the dream I had where you were more, than I knew just yet

and yet it's just the thing that wont, finally let me quit
it's like I got bit and your hips, are what keep me sick

do-dododo do-dododo ...


Well I guess it's all the things that never could've been 
that seduced me more than you ever made me bleed

--c--
O-oh but, in the end that's the one thing
O-oh but, in the end that's the one thing
--c--

and i guess it's all these word that I've saved for years
that seem to fall on your indifferent ears

--c--
O-oh but, in the end that's the one thing
O-oh but, in the end that's the one thing
--c--


This sighing hope
This trying light
Can't take but for the counterpart
that is the comfort in your heart

Cause this shiverin question on my quiverin lips
is still alive but dyin drownin
dyin down in the worry 

That this shiverin question on quiverin lips
has finally died down in the winter waters at last
oh it's, finally died down in the winter waters at last
oh it's, finally died down in the winter waters at last

do-dododo do-dododo ...
