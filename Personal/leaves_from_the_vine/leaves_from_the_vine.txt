Leaves from the vine				A
rise all in time					A
taken from the earth				D
they slowly birth					A

Though nothing’s made to last		A
and nothing made to stand			A
they climb up from the past			D
to find where they’ve been cast		F#m,E,A

But with and by the hands			A
made hard by demand					A
they’ll cut the final strands		D
and life will slip by like sand		E,D,A

Leaves from the vine				A
slowly fall in time					A
down to the river’s road			D
to meet the sea’s foam				A

So no matter you’ve gone			F#m,A
come on come on home				F#m,A
come on marching home				E,A
come on marching home				E,A

Fearless soldier boy				A
leave the brave behind				A
don’t let these leaves fall			D
before their own time				A

Oh little soldier boy				A
come on come on home				A
wherever you have roamed			D
you were all alone					A

Leaves from the vine				A
rise all in time					A
to be taken by the earth			D
and the ocean’s surf				A

So little soldier boy				A
come on come on home				A
come on marching home				D
come on marching home				E,D,A
