nothing_to_help_me_change
-------------------------

There is a place
Held in a warm embrace
Where I wont feel
The shadows on my face

But on my heals
I find the cards that I deal
The ones I know
Will wrap my fate in steal

So I’m frustrated with myself
But I got nothing to help me change
So it’s you I’ve got to use
But you’re the one who set the stage

Where I will go
Has no words to bestow
On weary hearts
Just regret to rock you to and fro

But tonight
I can’t see the sun in sight
And I don’t know
What to do till the suns alight

So I’m frustrated with myself
But I got nothing to help me change
So it’s you I’ve got to use
But you’re the one who set the stage

So I’m frustrated with myself
But I got nothing to help me change
So it’s you I’ve got to use
But you’re the one who set the stage

So now I’m bound and intertwined
In something I cant leave behind
Behind
Behind
Behind me
