G                       Cmaj7/G
When I think of all the things, you won't remember
G                         Cmaj7/G   Em    *G   *D   Cmaj7/G
that keep this ember burn bright, through this long december

And I can drink through the night, so I can forget
the dream I had where you were more, than I knew just yet

and yet it's just the thing that wont, finally let me quit
it's like I got bit and your hips, are what keep me sick

G *D Em G           ...Em
do-dododo do-dododo ...

F#m/A                                 G7    *D       Cmaj7/G
Well I guess it's all the things that never could've been 
F#m/A                                      Cmaj7/G
that seduced me more than you ever made me bleed

--c--
     Em                             Dadd9
O-oh but, in the end that's the one thing
     Em                             Dadd9
O-oh but, in the end that's the one thing
--c--
      A7                   Cmaj7/G     G7   *D        Cmaj7/G
and i guess it's all these words that I've saved for years
F#m/A                                 Cmaj7/G
that seem to fall on your indifferent ears

--c--
O-oh but, in the end that's the one thing
O-oh but, in the end that's the one thing
--c--

*Em
This sighing hope
Dadd9
This trying light

Cmaj7/G
Can't take but for the counterpart
                            G
that is the comfort in your heart

*Em                                Cmaj7/G  G
Cause this shiverin question on my quiverin lips
*Em
is still alive but dyin drownin
Cmaj7/G          G
dyin down in the worry

          *Em                  Cmaj7/G  G
That this shiverin question on quiverin lips
    *Em               Cmaj7/G                 G
has finally died down in the winter waters at last
         *Em               Cmaj7/G                 G
oh it's, finally died down in the winter waters at last
         *Em               Cmaj7/G                 G
oh it's, finally died down in the winter waters at last

G *D Em G... G *D Em G
do-dododo do-dododo ...
