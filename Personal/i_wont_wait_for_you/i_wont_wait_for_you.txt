Cadd9
Held a heart to fill
   G6              G
In dark and hidden hills
                      Cadd9
As if it was a way to will
             G
But I’m here still

If I could say this
It’d be you're the one I missed
Though the fear and tears persist
Know it’s you I kissed

--c--
Em                  G
Please, there is no need to stay
Cadd9               G
We’ll drink to this someday
Em                     G
And say that way leads on to way
Cadd9               G
By a will we cannot sway
--c--

My love has slowly grown
Not on thrones of solid stone
But on hope that this was home
And home alone

Yet we’re six feet deep
In promises we wont ever keep
It’s time to wake from this sleep
to set this free

So it's finally come to this
Hope that hangs on one last kiss
On lips that in this remiss
Far too much to fix

--c--
Please, there is no need to stay
We’ll drink to this someday
And say that way leads on to way
By a will we cannot sway

So leave me by the cold stone
And let free the swirling snow
This old heart is mine alone
This much I have always known
--c--

Em                 G
So leave me by the cold stone
Em                   G
just leave me by the cold stone
Em                  G
yes leave me by the cold stone
Cadd9                 G
let free the swirling snow
--c--
