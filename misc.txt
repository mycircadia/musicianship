Well you're quite the talker
You take up silence
Like it needs you more than me

But the lightest breeze is amber
When I come to find
Your hair is all I've seen

The early fog a nervous rising
It's Rising scared
Like I do to catch your eye

The sun is creepin on the morning
It's Creepin like I do
In the world behind my lies

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Don't you know you've been so austier,
and that your smile's been far from clear?

There's a lifetime rushing through, how I'd imagined
the drinks in our backyard, with laughter on a summer wind

And I've been leaning out my window, just so I can catch 
the last of it before I admit, the well's been dredged dry

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

My soul’s bound and intertwined
All twisted up in something I cant ever leave behind
But tell me and ease my mind
Whether yours is bound in kind.

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

kissin a cigarrette beneathe the downtown gloom
just breathin in the smoldered ash
weeavin me a costume full of smoke

it's dry and hollow like my crazy heart of hopes
but your perfume picks up the beat
seeps in my coat and exumes me whole

when I'm looking in your eyes the whole sky falls
cause you bat an eyelash and then I know
they're the only stars I needed to call

But now I'm lost in the city making it on my own
and I cry and curse those stained stars
while these scars turn my heart to stone

There’s something gone
But it’s made me strong
It’s brought me here
And made me free from fear
For me its long been time
To build from rags and climb
Who I was burned down
To the ground in that old town
Just take me as I am
Cause I’m not here for them

I know this ground well
It’s where you fell
To heaven straight through hell
On that path that we foretell

I know the day they said
That there was only red
You took to strong their words
Sold on the things you heard

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Just as before
I knew there was so much more
Life was an open door
Livin with hope that there’d be more

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

I once made a name
To forget the one that’s mine
There’s no going home with the one I own

I’ve been built on lies
Were truth a thing you could hide
You might just have stayed behind

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Though you’ll never know
That you were the heart of my show
Yes that you were the heart of my show
But snow will come
And snow will go
And hold down the seeds you’ve sown
The seeds that were never made to grow

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

In and for the while you were mine
Held you in my arms and gone with tired eyes
If I was wise id have known the wrong in time
But In and for the while it was mine

In the walk I was taken by your eyes
The shy silent hand set on mine
And the fool for two who was lost in you
Yet through and through I never knew

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

If fading fires burned high
And the flashing lips shined upon the sky
In a way so seductive to the eye
Then say you’d turn to me
And leave the tinkerer to his machinery
I’ve got belief behind the tears, fear, and honesty
So be the first to light the fires
Set the tired on the liars
To bring back a heart to its deep-seated beating
And with me we can be dancers in the doubt

But we can see that the darker night is nigh
Its shadows run awry with our walls climbing high
But there’s a silent safety in the arms of anyone
And the truth’s just as tall as the walls you cant outrun
So before we’re through it’ll make gamblers of us all

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

It’s just waiting for us, as it must
To see the builder’s feet that dare to trust
The things the hands had made
But that the words so strongly forbade

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

I’m taught and drawn from end to end
End to end
My souls been bending now
Lent it to my friends
But bending was always how
I leaned into
Into you

I caught the train I’m on
A thousand miles
A thousand miles
Before my waning dawn
Drawn down your crocked smile
But where it’s lead me to
Is silhouettes of you
And If find the color’s
Never there
Did I scare it all to black?
Please come back
Please come back now

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

I spend too many days wading through blank nights
knowing that memory served and saw to morning
knew sight crept through cracks to the sepia light
smelled the perfume that hung just dying on the walls
and heard her footfalls sounding slow down the hall
just to recall that warm drowning as you downed the drink
and ignored it all as curtains fell on memory's last call

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

This is what you do when the end aint here
but you fear its bed is where you're headed

You'll waste away by the wayside of anything
Where an undertoe's the office right uptown
the meaning's dead but for your aging crown
and this skins the real room you're dying in
