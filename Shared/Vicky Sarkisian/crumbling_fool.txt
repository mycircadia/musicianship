crumbling_fool
--------------

Stunning your eyes pierced into my soul
Charming your words took over control
Of my heart and I fell apart
So let me be
I can’t believe I’m at the start

So please
I cant breath
I can’t spend another moment wishing you were here with me

Just take it all
And watch me fall
You made me blind to see that love is cruel

And now
I’m a crumbling fool 
A crumbling fool
For you

Can’t seem to find the words
They all fly away like the birds
That glide through life so fearlessly
I wish that bird was me
But I am too in love 
To let it go
And I wish
I wish I had known

So please
I cant breath
I can’t spend another moment wishing you were here with me

Just take it all
And watch me fall
You made me blind to see that love is cruel

And now
I’m a crumbling fool 
A crumbling fool
For you

I still cry
Over the boy I thought I didn’t love
But I’ll pretend
As if to keep my head above
Above the waterfall
Higher than the mountain tall
I am flying
In the safer sky
Just don’t tell me goodbye
