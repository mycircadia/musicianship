------------

Alive and awake
Aware and controlled
I can think and dwell and grow.

I live further along this walk than I know
My mindâ€™s swirl provided me an answer, yet so
Lost I am in thought and time and in the air I see, You
God?
Or was it me?

Late, or later on.
My hands are low, long, and 
Thought; deep and clear,
Blurring at the bottom,
Falls slow into a space
of Something like fear.
