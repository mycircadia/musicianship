It’s not even missing when you don’t know what’s gone
When ghost live in your heart, your arms
Should rise to raise what’s dead
And to the sky with the question in your eyes
Ask why? Why won’t rest come to me in bed?

To hold each other, standing, side by side
To know our boldfaced lies
Is truth, and is greatest when it hurts
So do not leave a seed, it will only grow worse
