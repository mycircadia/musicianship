As I crossed the road
Casting off, heavier loads
Looking past, myself mute and lame
When’s the day you confidently say that I am changed?

Why’d I say I love you 
I don’t want to see
I just want to hold your hand 
And though I know you deeper 
Still how could I decree
Both of us could rule this land
	
Co-ome back to me
Co-ome back my sweet.

It’s not even missing when you don’t know what’s gone
Ghost live up your hands, Your arms 
will raise in anguish, with questions simply said.
Why Lord? Why can’t rest come to me?

Holding each other, standing, side by side
Knowing each others, bold face lies
Truth is greater, even when it hurts
Regret last longer than parting in the worst

Co-ome back to me
Co-ome back my sweet.

Emotion, anger, silence, call;
“It’s nothing” means nothing at all. Okay
please just say something. To leave hot words cold
Le’spirit descalier. All thought none told.

Why’d I say I love you 
I don’t want to see
I just want to hold your hand 
And though I know you deeper 
Still how could I decree
Both of us could rule this land
	
Co-ome back to me
Co-ome back my sweet.
